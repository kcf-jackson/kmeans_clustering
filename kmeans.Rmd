Algorithm: k-means
Task: clustering

Background:

Summary:
Theory: No theoretical guanrantee. Can be arbitrarily worse.
-> k-means++: O(log(k)) competitive with the optimal clustering.
[k-means++: The Advantages of Careful Seeding(2007)](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/778/1/2006-13.pdf)

Practice: Convenient to apply and fast convergence.

Scalability: 
- large n: 
-> [Scalable K-Means++(2012)](http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol5/p622_bahmanbahmani_vldb2012.pdf)
-> [Fast and Provably Good Seedings for k-Means(2016)](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6478-fast-and-provably-good-seedings-for-k-means.pdf)
- large p: naturally doesn't work due to the unusual geometry of high dimensional space.




This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
